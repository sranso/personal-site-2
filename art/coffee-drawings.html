  <h2>Coffee drawings</h2>
  <p>
      During my residency in Greece, Jane suggested I do coffee drawings every morning. For ~60 minutes, I look at the bottom of a coffee cup, find something that interests me, and draw. It's such a calming practice, like yoga for the creative brain. You can't get it "wrong" – what you see is what you see, these are smudges after all – and you get to work on expression, line work, composition, storytelling, engaging with the piece, and play without consequences.

      I think making art will always be a little scary, and this feels like taking a few laps around the track before getting into your workout (not that I run). I try to continue this practice even when I can't devote longer periods of time to art.
