  <h2>Coffee drawings</h2>
  <p>
      During my <a href="/art/paros-greece" target="_blank">residency in Greece,</a> Jane suggested I do coffee drawings every morning. For ~60 minutes, I'd look at the bottom of a coffee cup, find something that interested me, and draw. it's such a calming practice, like yoga for the creative brain. you can't get it "wrong" – what you see is what you see, you're looking at smudges – and you get to work on expression, line work, composition, storytelling, engaging with the piece, play without consequences.

      I think making art will always be a little scary, and this feels like taking a few laps around the track before getting into your workout (not that I run!). I try to continue this practice even when I can't devote longer periods of time to art.

      The notepad is 12 x 16.5", and the drawings are ink / gouache / watercolor / charcoal / graphite.
