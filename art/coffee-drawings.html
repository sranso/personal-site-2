  <h1>Coffee drawings</h1>
  <p>
      During my 2022 residency in Greece, <a href="http://www.janepack.net/" target="_blank">Jane</a> suggested I do coffee drawings every morning. For ~60 minutes, I look at the bottom of a coffee cup (with residual coffee grounds, tea leaves, matcha, etc), find something interesting, and draw.
      It's such a calming practice, like yoga for the creative brain, or a visual version of <a href="https://juliacameronlive.com/basic-tools/morning-pages/" target="_blank">The Artist Way's morning pages</a>.
      You can't get it "wrong" – what you see is what you see – and you get to work on expression, line work, composition, storytelling, engaging with the piece, and free play.
