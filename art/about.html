  <h2>About</h2>

  <p>I am a graduate of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a degree in History and Environmental Studies.
    I took a year off in college to study art at <a href="https://www.aegeancenter.com/" target="_blank">The Aegean Center</a>,
    which kicked off my life-long interest in studying and practicing art. For six years I studied and performed
    improvisational comedy in NC and NYC. I have drawn illustrations for
    <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/sarah-ransohoff">The New Yorker</a>.
    In January 2022 I quit my job to devote the year towards seeing how deeply I can go in art. I've started the year with three months
    in Paros, Greece studying with Jane Pack from The Aegean Center.

  <p>I am the Art Director for <a href="https://scone-heads.com/" target="_blank">Scone Heads</a> and maker of <a href="https://prettygoodtherapy.com/" target="_blank">Pretty Good Therapy.</a></p>
