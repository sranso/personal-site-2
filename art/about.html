  <h3 class="mt4 f2 lh-copy">Artist statement</h3>
  <p>
    Practice and enlightenment are one phenomenon â€“ when we are present to the work, we can make art. I am drawn to intimate and quiet subject matter found in nature, in people I care about, in animals. I owe much of my growth as an artist to working alongside others.
