### dev descriptions
emergency motivator
ruby. built on sinatra. 
need motivation as you learn ruby and web development? no fear. emergency bootcamp motivator is here. and neither the background color nor the specific motivational quote will show twice in a row. which is good for morale.

inspirational quotes
ruby. javascript. angularjs. built on sinatra. 
using angularjs to enable real-time search and filtering, this app allows you to "crud" your favorite quotes without refreshing the page.

is it birthday?
ruby. built on sinatra. 
do you love bad grammar and holidays? me too. check out this site to learn what holiday it is (or isn't). you can even pretend that it's a holiday, and maybe ron burgundy will show up.

eat like a hobbit
css. ruby. built on sinatra. 
hobbits eat seven meals a day. why don't we? well, now you can. this app can help.

Vegout
HTML Forms. Ruby. Built on Sinatra. 
Want to create the character of a vegetable? Good. Take this quiz. Note the absence of CSS. You're welcome for the beauty.

project path
css. ruby. d3.js. javascript. ajax. angularjs. apis. built on rails. 
used linkedin api and scraper to retrieve data. implemented regex to get specific data out of linkedin api. created optimal json structure for d3.js to consume and visualize. used omniauth to authenticate with linkedin api. note that this project doesn't work exactly as we planned, but we learned a ton in the process. ask me about it!

google maps & nyc open data
ruby. javascript. built on sinatra. 
using relevant datasets from nyc open data, i utilized google maps api to visualize data. ajax requests load the data asynchronously, avoiding page refresh.
