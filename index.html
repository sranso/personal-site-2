  <h5>About</h5>
  <p>
    Hi, I'm Sarah Ransohoff. I am a software engineer, an improviser, a painter, and a real life human.
    I value communication, good questions, and fun.

  <h5>Education and Experience</h5>
  <p>
    I graduated from The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a degree in United States History,
    and I studied art history and studio art for a year in Italy and Greece with The Aegean Center.
    After teaching myself to use the Adobe Suite and a touch of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for four months,
    I went to The Flatiron School's Web Development Program for five months. For the next two years, I worked
    at <a href="https://www.venmo.com">Venmo</a> on the web team, building products that helped make Venmo safer and more accessible.
    And now, I'm at Recurse Center until November 2016, working on whatever my heart desires.
