    <h2>What now?</h2>
    <p>
      I'm looking for contract / FT work. <br/>
      <strong>Engineering: </strong>I'd love to help build scalable
      and accessible code to support the features and goals of the business. <br/>
      <strong>Management: </strong> I'm also available to manage and/or coach others in management skills,
      navigate difficult situations, or hire for a new team. <br/>
