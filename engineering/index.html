  <p class="mb6">
    I have worked in tech for 8 years as a software engineer and an engineering manager.
    I love working on teams where I can help people grow while moving the product forward.
    I value communication, organization, teamwork, and having fun.
    I'm currently available to help with things like web development, building a site using Squarespace, illustrations and/or commissioned art.
    See below for examples and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16krVMfytp0VEY3NZaSoCM6iPyOabkHJFkjRbSvSLfK4/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>
