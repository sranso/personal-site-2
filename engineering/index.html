  <h1>Engineering</h1>
  <p>
    I have been in-house in the tech world for 8 years, with the last 3 focused on engineering management.
    I love working on teams where I can help people grow while moving product forward.
    I value communication, organization, teamwork, and having fun.

    <strong>I'm currently open to contract work</strong> to help with things like <i>designing and/or building a website</i> (natively or on SquareSpace)
    and <i>management coaching.</i>
