  <p>
  This morning I was going through the <a href="https://www.elm-tutorial.org/en/03-subs-cmds/02-commands.html">Elm docs</a> and I came across this line that caused me to pause:<br/>
  </p>
  <p class="quote">
  In Elm, commands (Cmd) are how we tell the runtime to execute things that involve side effects.
  </p>

  <p>
  I understood "runtime" to be the length of time a program took to run, so this sentence confused me. After talking about it with some people from RC, we learned that, depending on the context, "runtime" can mean different things:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>"the runtime"/"the runtime environment" = the programming language's own internal code that runs alongside the code you provided, the environment inside of which your program runs</li>
    <li>"at runtime" = things that don't happen until your code is running, like the way JS and Python don't always show you syntax errors until you get into the bad function</li>
    <li>"runtime" = amount of execution time taken</li>
    <li>"runtime" (adjective) = specifies something that happens while your code is running in the browser, eg "runtime exception"</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Thanks to Juliano Solanho and Chris Ball for their help!</p>
