While working on <a href="https://github.com/sranso/sreact">a project</a>, I came across a confusing failing test:
</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
// this test
it('should return an html string', () => {
  expect(createElement(node)).to.be.instanceof(String);
});
// was failing:
1) createElement module createElement should return an html string:
AssertionError: expected '<div style="text-align: center; color: blue; margin: 20px" id="vdom"><p style="font-size: 20px;">12345</p></div>' to be an instance of String
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
Why, though? <code>createElement(node)</code> does, in fact, return a string. So I went to the console:
</p>

<img src="/images/instanceof-typeof-constructor.png" />

<p>
These things seemed to be in contradiction. How could <code>n</code> be a type
of string, whose constructor is also a string,
but is not in fact an instance of a string?
</p>

<p>
Looking at the MDN docs for
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/instanceof">
  <code>instanceof</code>
</a>, it also seemed like this shouldn't be true:
</p>

<p class="quote">
<i>object</i> instanceof <i>constructor</i>
</p>

<p>
With the help of James Porter, I found
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/203739/why-does-instanceof-return-false-for-some-literals#203757">
  this helpful StackOverflow post
</a>
which explains how string literals "are a different kind of object than objects created from within Javascript." 
So, for example, creating a string literal
{% highlight javascript %}
var string = 'boop';
typeof string; // 'string'
{% endhighlight %}
is different from creating a string object using the <code>String</code> function.
{% highlight javascript %}
var string = new String('boop');
typeof string; // 'object'
{% endhighlight %}
These two vars, while they both behave as strings as far as we are concerned, are of different instances.
</p>

<p>
Why is that? JavaScript is a prototype-based language (versus class-based). So, objects aren't instances of
a class. Rather, you can only check if an object has another object in its prototype chain somewhere.
And since literals are not an object, while a string created by the String constructor is,
the string literal is not an instance of String.

JavaScript wat.
