<h2 class="ttu">{{ page.title }}</h2>

<p>
A few weeks ago, I <a href="/posts/2016/10/06/recreate-virtual-dom.html" class="link black underline hover-bg-light-blue">wrote</a>
about the process of recreating a virtual DOM.
Since then I’ve made a lot of changes and progress that I’d like to share, or at the very least, log for myself.
</p>

<p>
First, let’s take a look at an example of this virtual DOM in action!
Below is a simple todo list generator I made using my virtual DOM.
</p>

<p>
<span class="b ttu">demo</span>
<span class="i">source code <a href="https://github.com/sranso/sreact" class="link black underline hover-bg-light-blue">here</a></span>
</p>

<div class="pa4 overflow-scroll ba b--dashed vh-50 mb5">
  <div id="root"></div>
  <script src="{{ page.custom_js }}" type="text/javascript"></script>
</div>

<h2 class="b">How it works</h2>

<p>
On a high level, here's what's happening in this demo:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create an initial virtual tree</li>
  <li>Render this initial virtual tree into the DOM (by diffing it against an empty virtual DOM and applying those patches to the real DOM)</li>
  <li>A user (you) submits a todo</li>
  <li>A new virtual tree is created, one that contains the new todo but is otherwise the same as the previous virtual tree</li>
  <li>Compare the new virtual tree with the old virtual tree, and find the differences (items that we need to: replace, add, or delete)</li>
  <li>Apply those differences (aka patches) to the real DOM, <span class="i">only</span> changing what <span class="i">needs</span> to be changed
    (you can confirm this by opening up the dev tools and watching the DOM in the elements tab as you add todos)
  </li>
  <li>Replace our old virtual tree reference with this new, updated virtual tree so the program knows about the latest virtual DOM representation</li>
  <li>Start listening for more changes</li>
</ul>

<p>
Let's look closer at some of these key parts.
</p>

<p class="b">1. Create virtual DOM (vDOM)</p>
<p>
Create a vDOM that has one root node and many child nodes. This is our original DOM representation.
</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
const vDom = createNode('div', { }, [
  createNode('form', { }, [
    createNode('label', { }, [ 'add a todo' ]),
    createNode('input', {
      type: 'text',
      id: 'text'
    }, [ '' ]),
    createNode('input', {
      type: 'submit',
      value: 'save todo',
      onClick: saveTodo
    }, [ '' ])
  ]),
  createNode('div', { }, [ 'todos' ]),
  createNode('ul', { }, mapTodos(JSON.parse(localStorage.todos)))
]);
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
<code>createNode</code> takes three things: an element type, an object of HTML attributes and/or event listeners, and an array of children.
It returns a <code>VirtualNode</code> whose children are either other <code>VirtualNode</code>s or, if the child is a string,
a <code>VirtualText</code> node.
</p>

<p class="b">2. Call render</p>

<p>
On a high level, <code>render</code> takes a vDOM and the DOM root in which to render the vDOM,
and then performs a lot of the logic we discussed above.
</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
// keep track of the latest vDOM
let tree = new VirtualNode('', {}, []);

const render = (vRoot, domRoot) => {
  // add a reference to the root DOM element to the tree. this part will only happen on the first render
  if (!tree.$el) {
    tree.$el = domRoot;
  }
  // find all differences between the old tree and the new one
  let patches = diff(tree, vRoot)
  // apply all these patches
  patch(domRoot, patches)
  // add a root node to the new tree
  let newTree = new VirtualNode('', {}, [vRoot]);
  // save a reference to the root DOM element to the new tree
  newTree.$el = domRoot;
  // replace the old with the new
  tree = newTree;

  return tree;
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
Let's look a little closer at <code>diff</code> and <code>patch</code>, as these are two key
parts of a functioning virtual DOM.
</p>

<div class="ml4">
  <p class="b">i. diff between the old vDOM and the new vDOM</p>
  <p>
    <code>diff</code> takes two vDOMs and finds all differences (or patches) between these two trees.
    It returns an array of patches (<code>VirtualPatch</code>) that have a type (replace, add, or delete),
    a patch node, a parent node, and a replace target (if the type is replace).
  </p>
  <p>
    The algorithm is pretty long so I won't show it all here, but if you want to take a look you can
    see it on <a href="https://github.com/sranso/sreact/blob/master/src/diff.js" class="link black underline hover-bg-light-blue">github.</a>
    On a high level (and in pseudo-code!), this is what happens:
  </p>

{% highlight javascript %}
const diff = (oldTree, newTree) => {
  // kick off walking both trees, while keeping track of the parent node
  return walk(oldTree.children[0], newTree, oldTree);
};

const walk = (oldTree, newTree, parentNode) => {
  if (oldTree === newTree) {
    return;
  }

  if (!oldTree) {
    // patch type: ADD
    return [new VirtualPatch(newTree, parentNode, 'ADD')];
  } else if (!newTree) {
    // patch type: DEL
    return [new VirtualPatch(oldTree, parentNode, 'DEL')];
  } else if (oldTree !== newTree) {
    // patch type: REPL
    return [new VirtualPatch(newTree, parentNode, 'REPL', oldTree)];
  } else {
    // check children for patches
    const maxChildren = Math.max(oldTree.children.length, newTree.children.length);
    let childPatchesArray = [];

    for (let i = 0; i <= maxChildren; i++) {
      const oldTreeChild = oldTree.children[i];
      const newTreeChild = newTree.children[i];
      const childPatch = walk(oldTreeChild, newTreeChild, oldTree);
      if (childPatch) {
        childPatchesArray = childPatchesArray.concat(childPatch);
      }
    }
    return childPatchesArray;
  }
};
{% endhighlight %}

  <p class="b">ii. patch those differences onto the DOM</p>
  <p>
    <code>patch</code> takes the root DOM node and the array of patches (provided to us by the <code>diff</code>
    algorithm), finds the DOM nodes that need patches applied, and applies them.
    This is when the DOM actually gets updated.
  </p>

{% highlight javascript %}
const patch = (domNode, patches) => {
  // need to reverse patches so they get applied in order
  patches.reverse().forEach(applyPatch);

  return domNode;
};

const applyPatch = ({ patchNode, parentNode, type, replTarget }) => {
  if (type === 'ADD') {
    parentNode.$el.appendChild(patchNode.$el);
  } else if (type === 'DEL') {
    parentNode.$el.removeChild(
      $patchEl
    );
  } else if (type === 'REPL') {
    parentNode.$el.replaceChild(
      patchNode.$el,
      replTarget.$el
    );
  }
};
{% endhighlight %}

<h2 class="b">Various approaches I took</h2>

<p>
I took a lot of different approaches to get to this current implementation.
These are listed in chronological order of implementation (so, the last note is
the current implementation). As I'm sure you can imagine, if an implementation
was abandoned, it was abandoned because I hit a problem with that implementation.
Obstacles drive creativity!
(If you have any questions about why an approach was abandoned, shoot me an email /
tweet and we can talk about it.)
</p>

<span class="b">General things</span>
<ul>
  <li>Use simple objects</li>
  <li>Use classes (eg VirtualNode, VirtualText, VirtualPatch)</li>
</ul>

<code>createNode</code>
<ul>
  <li>Represent nodes using elm-like div representation (eg ['p', { class: 'inline' }, [ 'hello world' ]]); no ids</li>
  <li>Represent nodes as simple objects, with ids (eg { elType: 'p', atts: { class: 'inline' }, children: [ 'hello world' ], id: 1 } )</li>
  <li>Represent nodes as as either VirtualNode or VirtualText</li>
  <li><span class="i">Only</span> give ids to nodes that need them</li>
  <li>Give <span class="i">no</span> nodes ids; instead, give each node a reference to their DOM el</li>
</ul>

<code>render</code>
<ul>
  <li>Simply render the created element into DOM</li>
  <li>Be a wrapper for all logic around diffing and patching, plus keep a reference to the latest tree</li>
</ul>

<code>createElement</code>
<ul>
  <li>Return a string (eg root.innerHTML = createElement(vNode))</li>
  <li>Return a DOM node (eg root.appendChild(createElement(vNode)))</li>
</ul>

<code>diff</code>
<ul>
  <li>Store a reference to the target node</li>
  <li>Store a path to target node</li>
  <li>Return an object of patches with keys as indices of the parent node, and the values as patches</li>
  <li>Create DOM elements while diffing, and save a reference to the element on each virtual node</li>
  <li>Return an array of patches</li>
</ul>

<code>patch</code>
<ul>
  <li>Apply patches while traversing vdom, and somehow find the corresponding element in the DOM (how, lol)</li>
  <li>Apply patches using each virtual node's reference to its DOM element (no manual DOM walking)</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="b">Other implementations</h2>

<p>
Other libraries implement the virtual DOM differently. Here are a few other implementations that I looked at while
making my own virutal DOM in an attempt to understand where to get started and how others were approaching the problem.
</p>

</li>
</ul>


<h2 class="b">Moving forward</h2>

<p>
There are obviously lots of things I could do to improve this virtual DOM implementation, a few being...
</p>

<ul>
<li>Use JSX</li>
<li>Add more rigorous tests</li>
<li>Be more selective about what qualifies as a patch (eg if the first item in a list changes, but the rest don't, don't replace <span class="i">all</span> the preceding nodes;
  just replace the one that changed)</li>
</ul>

<p>
In the meantime, I built a thing! And I'm pretty proud of it. ;)
